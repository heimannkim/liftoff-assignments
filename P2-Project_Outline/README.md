## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I'm creating an application to help families create their shopping list.  The original user will login and create the first shopping list.  The user will get a key to share with the family.  The family can use the key to add to the list.  The user will have an up-to-date list when it's time to shop.  Once created, the user will then be able to pull up the current list for future shopping and hide items that are not needed this time and include more items.
I got the idea from a co-worker with 5 young children.  He would like an app that works on his phone so his wife can add items to the list.  The original design will not work quite that way, but could be an update at a later stage in development.

### Features
User login:  User can go to a landing page and create an account, receive a key that can be shared with others, and start a shopping list.
Create/Edit shopping list:  Users can add, edit, or hide items in their shopping list.
Access shopping list:  Users can send an email or text to their phone when they're ready to shop.  In final stage, users would be able to access shopping list directly from app on their phone.

### Technologies
Java
IntelliJ IDE
Spring Boot
Gradle
Thymeleaf
MAMP

### What I'll Have to Learn
I don't know anything about creating a database in a cloud to make it easier for users to eventually access the database directly from their phones.  Also, I don't know anything about creating an app for ios or android use.
